## Polyfill

A polyfill, or polyfiller, is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.

### Example

```javascript
if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
  String.prototype.startsWith = function (searchString, position) {
    position = position || 0;
    return this.substr(position, searchString.length) === searchString;
  };
}
```

## Babel

Babel's original name was slightly more descriptive - 6to5. This was because, originally, Babel converted ES6 code to ES5 code. Now, Babel does a lot more. It'll convert ES6 to ES5, JSX to JavaScript, and Flow to JavaScript.
