# Syntax

### Let and Const

* Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned and can’t be redeclared in the same scope.
* Variables declared with `const` must be assigned an initial value and can’t be redeclared in the same scope and can’t be reassigned.
* There is no reason to use `var` anymore.
